# ToDoLinkedList
The goal of this project is to create a simple to-do list manager where users can add tasks, mark tasks as completed, and view their list of tasks. Each user has their own to-do list, and each to-do list is represented as a single linked list of tasks. The users are stored in an array/arraylist.
